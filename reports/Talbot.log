## Talbot carpet

This code makes a plot of a **Talbot carpet**, named after 
<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Fox_Talbot">Henry Fox Talbot</a> (Feb 11, 1800 - Sept 17, 1877),
who observed the effect in 1836. 
The physics is identical to $N$-slit, where $N$ is relatively large. The Talbot carpet is formed
in the near-field of the grating. To model the near field we use the Fresnel integrals, see
<a href = "https://global.oup.com/academic/product/optics-f2f-9780198786795?cc=gb&lang=en&">Optics f2f</a> Sec. 5.10.

The code allows us to vary both the width of each slit $a$ and the spacing between them $d$.

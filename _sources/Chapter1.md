# Introduction

In this Chapter we  look wave soltions of Maxwell's equation and 
introduce the phasor concept.

The simulation illustrates the idea of the oscilltion of light waves and the phasor representation. It links closely to Figs. 1.3 and 1.4,

For Fig. 1.7 see Chapter 12. For Fig. 1.10 see Chapter 10.

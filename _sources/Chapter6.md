# Many waves: Fourier

Chapter 6 is about many waves again but this time we use **Fourier transforms** to
perform the sum.

We shall consider the propagation of light---using the Hedgehog equation (or angular spectrum method) and calculate **Fresnel** and **Fraunhofer diffraction** patterns in a particular plane. 

Specific examples include: Fraunhofer diffraction for aperatures 
with the shape of **letters** and **arrays**.

Note that there are many excellent python based diffraction simulators online, e.g.

https://opticspy.github.io/lightpipes/

https://github.com/rafael-fuente/diffractsim

https://diffractio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Our goal here is to provide relatively simple code blocks to
assist the interested reader of **Opticsf2f** in writing their own 
simulations of the topics covered.
